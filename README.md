## About us:

Charles Sebold is the founder and primary developer at Foundry-9 LLC, based in the St. Louis Metro East area in Illinois, USA.

I tend to write the tools I need, and as a fiction writer I needed something to keep track of a very large stack of worldbuilding notes. I live in [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md/) most of the time, but it's helpful to have an LLM able to find things quickly and remind what Lady This or powerful wizard That did, or said, or was capable of, or how their backstory dovetailed into others.

Next thing I knew, I had started to write a standalone Python MCP to get my note data searchable (semantically) and available to Claude - not just for it to find things, but to change them. "No, no, the knight Thusandsuch had an *azure* shield, fix that."

It worked but it was bloated, and making sure that Python always knew how to edit small pieces of large files was a hassle, as was token management. An 8K word chapter does not make for a happy LLM.

I'm trying to get [F9 Lore MCP](https://github.com/foundry-9/f9-lore-mcp) into Obsidian's plugin catalog now. It's fast and it works; we eat our own dog food here.

For crazier things, check out [Quilltap](https://github.com/foundry-9/quilltap), my alternative front-end for hosted LLMs and roleplay. Business in the front, party in the back.
